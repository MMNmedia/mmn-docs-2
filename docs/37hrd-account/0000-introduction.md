# Introduction

## What is a 37HRD Account?
A 37HRD Account can be used to access internal MMN services.

## What can it do?
37HRD Accounts can be used to control a range of internal web services at MMN, including:

* Email accounts (aliases and forwarding)
* Hosted websites
* Domains and subdomains
* Proxies
* NAS storage

## Eligibility
37HRD Accounts are created manually and cannot be granted to the general public, as their purpose is to provide backend access to websites, services and servers - some of which are considered 'high-risk'.

That said, you may be eligible for a 37HRD Account if:

* you are a MMN employee or developer
* you are a MMN volunteer or affiliate
* you work at an organisation whose media services are provided by MMN
* you are affiliated with an organisation where MMN provides its core media services
