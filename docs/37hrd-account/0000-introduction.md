# Introduction

## What is a 37HRD Account?
A 37HRD Account can be used to access internal MMN services.

## Eligibility
37HRD Accounts are created manually and cannot be granted to the general public, as their purpose is to provide backend access to websites, services and servers - some of which are considered 'high-risk'.

That said, you may be eligible for a 37HRD Account if:
- you are a MMN employee or developer
- you are a MMN volunteer or affiliate
- you work at an organisation whose media services are provided by MMN
- you are affiliated with an organisation where MMN provides its core media services

## Sign Up
There is no public sign-up utility, and all registrations are strictly invitation-only.

If you are eligible and have not yet received your invite, you can contact your organisation's accounts manager via the relevant form below.
