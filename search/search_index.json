On the new screen, give your repository a name and make sure to check <code>Include all branches</code>. This will make sure that the <code>gh-pages</code> branch is included, or otherwhise publishing the docs to GitHub Pages could cause errors (See Troubleshooting).</p>"},{"location":"#creating-pages","title":"Creating pages","text":"<p>To create new pages, just add new markdown files to the docs folder of the repository and edit them. MkDocs will then turn those into static HTML pages once you build or deploy the pages.</p> <p>The template also has some pre-made settings for you to help you with creating documentation much easier. In the mkdocs.yml will you find many settings that you can alter. Please check the comments and the links they have for more info.</p> <p>It also contains some extensions that might be useful including:</p> <ul> <li>Admonition</li> <li>CodeHilite</li> <li>ToC</li> <li>PyMdown Extensions</li> </ul> <p>You're free to add, edit or remove any extension at your own discretion, but keep in mind that some expansions might caus compatibility issues with others.</p>"},{"location":"#build-pages","title":"Build Pages","text":"<p>To build pages (locally) can you use the <code>mkdocs build</code> command in your prefered command prompt.

This workflow will setup Python, download Material for MkDocs and all its dependencies and deploy the pages to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch to then be viewable under <code>&lt;username&gt;.github.io/&lt;repository&gt;</code> (unless you defined a specific CNAME through a CNAME file in the docs folder).</p> <p>Note that in order for this to work will you need to have a <code>gh-pages</code> branch already made.</p>"},{"location":"#netlify","title":"Netlify","text":"<p>Netlify is an amazing service to build and deploy pages.

What is the issue?</p> <p>There can be many issues but the most common ones are that you either don't have a <code>gh-pages</code> branch set or that the <code>requirements.txt</code> file is missing or its content is invalid.</p> <p>Can I alter the overall style of the pages?</p> <p>Yes. Material for MkDocs supports Theme extensions, meaning you can override specific parts of a theme by providing the particula file in a folder and defining this folder as the <code>custom_dir</code> one in the mkdocs.yml. This template ships with a <code>theme</code> folder that can be used for that and you can just uncomment the aforementioned line in the YAML file.</p>"},{"location":"#dependabot","title":"Dependabot","text":"<p>The repository contains a <code>dependabot.yml</code> file inside the <code>.github</code> folder which allows automatic updates through GitHub's Dependabot.

Those labels don't exist by default so you have to either create them, or alter the ones in the dependabot.yml (You can also just remove the <code>labels</code> sections).</p>"},{"location":"#credits","title":"Credits","text":"<p>A big thank you goes to the following people/groups:</p> <ul> <li>MkDocs for providing the software, to generate documentation.</li> <li>squidfunk for the MkDocs Material Theme.</li> <li>facelessuser for the PyMdown Extensions.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#license","title":"License","text":"<p>This template is served under the MIT license.
